# Deprecated: Legacy Architecture Note

This document is intentionally kept as a placeholder for historical continuity.

The legacy architecture described in earlier versions has been removed from the active product narrative.

## Current system summary

- **Web (`web/`)**: onchain identity/control UI and Nad.fun token launch flows.
- **Runner (`runner/`)**: simulated leaderboard/performance/trade history.
- **Connector layer (optional)**: proposal ingestion and heartbeat observability for OpenClaw-style integrations.

For current technical details, see:

- `README.md`
- `docs/architecture.md`
- `runner/README.md`
- `web/README.md`
